## Getting Started
Before you run our scripts, make sure that you place ```train.csv``` and ```submission.csv``` into ../data. 

Matplotlib, Numpy and Seaborn(for vizualisation) are required.

## Scripts:

```run.py```  - file for counting base model results.
Example
```
python run.py -path ../data/train.csv
```

## Results:
### ```BaselineModels.ipynb``` 

notebook for analysis for base models.

### ```DataPreprocessedModels.ipynb```  

notebook with dataprocessing and feature expansion.
